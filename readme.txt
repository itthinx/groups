Groups is an efficient and powerful solution, providing group-based user membership management, group-based capabilities and content access control.

== Description ==

### What is Groups? ###

The Groups plugin for WordPress is an essential tool that helps you organize users on your website. Think of it like sorting people into different clubs or teams, where each club has its own set of rules about who can access and do what.

### Why use it? ###

This plugin is very useful if you want to control who can see certain content or perform specific actions on your website. It helps you to keep some parts of your website exclusive to specific groups or to give special rights to some users.

Groups works great with WooCommerce, so you can make some products only available to members of certain groups.

### What it Does ###

It allows you to create groups, assign users to these groups, and set permissions for what each group can do or see on your site.

### Ease of Use ###

The Groups plugin works within the familiar WordPress Dashboard, so you do not need to learn something completely new. Clean views and clear functions make it quick and easy to work with.

### Control Content ###

You can make parts of your website visible to members of specific groups only, which is great for managing exclusive areas and products. You can protect whole pages, products and other types of content. You can also protect sections within pages.

### Control Permissions ###

Define what actions users in particular groups can perform, based on standard WordPress capabilities and custom capabilities provided by plugins.

### In a Nutshell ###

The Groups plugin makes managing your WordPress site easier, especially if you need to control who can do what or see what. It is designed to be easy to use, reducing the complexity of user management and content access.

Groups integrates with [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to protect access to products, so that certain products can be purchased by members only.

Enhanced functionality is available via the [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/vendor/itthinx/) and [Extensions](https://www.itthinx.com/product-category/groups/) for Groups.

### Key Features ###

#### Membership Management ####

You can put users into different groups, similar to assigning them to different classes or teams.

#### Content Access Control ####

You can decide that only specific groups can see certain content, posts, pages or products. If you are not in the right group, you will not see that protected content.

#### Capabilities ####

You can assign special rights to users based on which group they are a member of.

### Framework ###

Groups is designed as an efficient, powerful and flexible solution for group-oriented memberships and content access control.

It provides group-based user membership management, group-based capabilities and access control for content, built on solid principles.

Groups is light-weight and offers an easy user interface, while it acts as a framework and integrates standard WordPress capabilities and application-specific capabilities along with an extensive API.

The official documentation is located at the [Groups Documentation](https://docs.itthinx.com/document/groups/) pages.

#### Access control ####

Access to posts, pages and custom post types can be restricted by group.

If access to a post is restricted to one or more groups, only users who belong to one of those groups may view the post.

Fully supports custom post types, so that access to post types such as products or events can easily be restricted.

- Built-in access control that allows to restrict access to posts, pages and custom content types to specific groups and users only
- Control access to content by groups: shortcodes allow to control who can access content on posts, show parts to members of certain groups or to those who are not members -
  Shortcodes: [groups_member], [groups_non_member]
- Control access to content by capabilities: show (or do not show) content to users who have certain capabilities -
  Shortcodes: [groups_can], [groups_can_not]
- Blocks: The Groups Member block allows to restrict the visibility of its content to members of selected groups.
  The Groups Non-Member block hides its content from members of chosen groups.
  The blocks can be nested to provide multiple layers of access control to content.

- Integrates nicely with the standard WordPress Users menu
- Provides an intuitive Groups menu
- Conceptually clean views showing the essentials
- Quick filters
- Bulk-actions where needed, for example apply capabilities to groups, bulk-add users to groups, bulk-remove users from groups

= I have a question, where do I ask? =

For questions directly related to Groups, you can leave a comment at the [Groups Plugin](https://www.itthinx.com/plugins/groups/) page.

= How do I restrict access to a post? =

Let's assume you want members of the *Premium* group to be able to view some restricted posts.

- If you want to create a new protected post, simply go to *Posts > Add New* as usual and in the _Groups_ box input *Premium* in the _Read_ field. Save or publish your post.
- If you want to protect an existing post you can simply edit it, input *Premium* in the _Read_ field of the _Groups_ box and update the post.

In both cases, it doesn't matter if the *Premium* group already exists or not, if it doesn't, it will be created automatically.

If the *Premium* group already exists and you want to protect one or more existing posts in bulk, go to *Posts*, select all posts you want to protect and choose *Edit* in the *Bulk Actions* dropdown.
Now click *Apply*, select the *Premium* group and click *Update*.

After you publish or update your posts, only members of the *Premium* group will be able to see them.

= I want Advanced and Premium members, where the Premium members can access everything that Advanced members can access. How can I do that? =

Example: Advanced and Premium members

1. Go to *Groups > Groups > New Group* and add two new groups, let's call them *Advanced* and *Premium* - select *Advanced* as the *Parent* for the *Premium* group.
2. Now create an example post that only members of the *Advanced* group should be able to access and choose the *Advanced* group in the _Read_ field of the _Groups_ box.
3. Create another post for members of the *Premium* group and choose the *Premium* group for that post.
4. Assign test users to both groups, log in as each user in turn and see which posts will be accessible.

= How do I limit access to posts so that users in group A can not read the same as those in group B and vice-versa? =

Example: Green and Red members

1. Go to *Groups > Groups > New Group* and add two new groups, let's call them *Green Members* and *Red Members*
2. Now create an example post that only members of the *Green Members* group should be able to see and choose the *Green Members* group in the _Groups_ box.
3. Create another post for *Red Members* and choose the *Red Members* group for that post.
4. Assign a test user to each of the groups, log in as one of them and you will see that the member of the *Green Members* group will only have access to the post protected by that group but not to the post protected with the *Red Members* group and vice-versa.

= Are access restrictions for Custom Post Types (CPT) supported? =

Yes. Access restrictions can be turned on or off for specific CPTs on the *Groups > Options* page.

= How can I show groups that users belong to on their profile page in the admin section? =

Go to *Groups > Options* and enable the option under *User profiles*.

= Developers ... aka ... What about Groups' API? =

The Groups plugin provides an extensive framework to handle memberships, group-based capabilities and access control.

The API documentation page is available at [API](https://docs.itthinx.com/document/groups/api/).
